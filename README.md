# MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs
MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs is a Valheim mod to make all vanilla prefabs buildable with the hammer while allowing you to configure the requirements to build them. You can configure which prefabs are available for building and what the building requirements are, though the mod comes with a vanilla progression friendly default configuration that enables over 100 new pieces so you can start playing right away without any hassle or worrying about unlocking pieces you haven't found in the world yet.

**Server-Side Info**: This mod does work as a client-side only mod. It is strongly recommended that you install it on the server you play on if possible though as multiple players with conflicting configurations can result in losing build resources when pieces are deconstructed. Not installing the mod on the server also means that some pieces (like the new ship) may not function well for players without the mod.

**ASHLANDS UPDATE NOTICE:** The Ashlands update changed the name of some piece categories so you will need to either edit your configuration to change "Building" to "BuildingWorkbench" or delete your cfg and let the mod regenerate it. All pieces other than fires/explosions are now also patched to be placeable by default. Default building requirements for new pieces and snap points are still a work in progress though.

## Key Feature
Because all the added build pieces are pre-existing vanilla prefabs, any pieces you build with this mod will persist in your world even if you uninstall the mod. This means that pieces you build on a server will also be visible for players without the mod and any builds using the pieces from this mod will load for players without the mod.

### Example Builds
If you want to see what kind of pieces get added by default and are unlocked as you progress through each biome you can take a look at these builds shared by MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs users (thanks to DreamWraith and Goldenrevolver!). Builds are grouped by based on the biome that the pieces used in the build are unlocked (when using the default mod configuration) and the sections containing the images are collapsed by default so people can avoid spoilers if they wish to. Also, if you make a build using MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs and want it to be featured here let me know!

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there and skip to step 3 below. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim (BepInEx) and the Jotunn plugin installed.

1. Download the MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs.dll from the Publish\Thunderstore directory.
2. Place the MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs.dll into your BepInEx\plugins folder
3. Launch the game and enter a world to generate the configuration files. The plugin searches for prefabs in the game loading screen.
4. (Optional) Edit the default configuration using an in-game configuration manager or find the file Searica.Valheim.MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs.cfg in your BepInEx\config folder and edit it to customize mod configuration (see Configuration section for details).
5. Play the game using the default configuration generated by the mod or your customized one.

**Recommended:** Install [SearsCatalog](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/SearsCatalog/) to extend the hammer build table and allow you to access all the pieces this mod adds even if there are too many added pieces for the vanilla build table. If you install the mod from Thunderstore via r2modman or Thunderstore mod manager then SearsCatalog will automatically be installed as well.

## Configuration
Most changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (options requiring a restart will explicitly say so) and they will also sync to clients if the mod is on the server. The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager (changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

### Default Configuration
The mod has a default configuration that enables ~100 new pieces by default. The configuration settings for these pieces are intended to provide a reasonable balance and ensure that someone playing with the mod will only unlock various build pieces after encountering them in the world. As you progress through the game you will also unlock torches that don't require fuel, fires that don't require fuel, and a new portal that can be configured to ignore portal restrictions. As the default settings are based on my preferences and not yours, you are of course able to change these default configurations however you please.

### Default Enabled Pieces

## Detailed Mechanics
This mod enables prefabs that were not intended to used for building by players, so they may lack things like proper collision or snap points. All of the prefabs enabled by the default configuration have been patched so they behave more lke vanilla pieces.These patches are applied whether the prefab is enabled for building or not to make sure that prefabs that have been placed previously still behave as intended (ie they don't lose their collision and fall though the world).

 As of version 1.0.0 and Valheim version 0.217.30, all prefabs detected by MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs are placeable without any changes to the configuration. If a prefab is not enabled by default then it may still behave unexpectedly after being placed though. MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs automatically detects all prefabs in Valheim, so future game updates may add more pieces that will require additional patches to work though.

If a piece is having issues during placement the PlacementPatch, ClipEverything, and ClipGround configuration options can be used to try resolving the issue. Please try toggling those settings if you encounter issues during piece placement.

Another solution for placement issues is using either [Snap Points Made Easy](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/MathiasDecrock/Snap_Points_Made_Easy/) by MathiasDecrock or [Extra Snap Points Made Easy](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Searica/Extra_Snap_Points_Made_Easy/) by Searica (that's me). Both of these mods allow you to manually select the snap points on the piece you are placing and the piece you are snapping to. Manually selecting the snap points can allow you to place a prefab that otherwise does not show up due to missing colliders.

Some prefabs cannot be removed after being placed, such as when you place mist. If I'm aware of the issue then I add a warning to the piece description.

If there is piece you would really like to build with that is buggy feel free to open an issue on Github making a feature request or reach out to me on my discord (see contributions section).

**TLDR:** Some prefabs other than the ones enabled by default may be buggy, please adjust your expectations accordingly.

## Custom Piece Categories
This mod adds two custom piece categories: **CreatorShop** and **Nature**. Pieces set to either of the custom categories will only be enabled for building if CreativeMode is set to True. Additionally, these pieces can only be deconstructed by the player who placed them and world-generated instances of these pieces cannot be deconstructed. This prevents player's from deconstructing things like world-generated trees, while still allowing them to build and deconstruct their own trees.

If multiple player's have this mod, the same restrictions still apply and they will not be able to deconstruct instances of  pieces set to either of the custom piece categories that were built by other players.

The AdminDeconstructOtherPlayers setting can allow players with admin status to deconstruct CreatorShop or Nature pieces built by other players, so that admins have a way to remove indestructible pieces. Even if you enable the AdminDeconstructOtherPlayers setting, admins are still not able to deconstruct world-generated instances of pieces set to the CreatorShop or Nature categories.

## Resource Costs and Drops
Since this mod adds more prefabs to the hammer, that means you can deconstruct more pieces. World-generated pieces will only drop their default drops, while player-built pieces will only drop the resources used to build them.

### Pickable Pieces
Building and deconstructing prefabs that have pickable components could potentially allow for exploits that create infinite resources. To prevent that, the following adjustments are made.

#### Pickable Resource Costs
If a prefab has a pickable component, such as a berry bush, then whatever resource it drops will always be added to the required resources for building it. The amount of the resource required to build the prefab will also always be equal to or greater than the amount of the resource that is dropped when you pick it (after accounting for world modifiers). These conditions will override the required resources set in the configuration file.

**Example:** If building a berry bush drops 1 berry when you pick it then no matter what the settings are in the configuration file it will always cost at least 1 berry to build the berry bush. If world modifiers are set to 2 so the bush would drop 2 berries then it will always cost at least 2 berries to build.

#### Pickable Resource Drops
When you deconstruct a prefab with a pickable component if the pickable item has not been picked then it will drop the pickable item. The resources dropped by deconstructing it will also be adjusted to reduce the amount of the pickable item drops by the amount that was gained by picking the item (after accounting for world modifiers).

**Example:** If you built a berry bush that cost 5 berries to build, then picked the berries and got 2 berries, and then deconstructed the bush only 3 berries would drop.

If a pickable piece has additional random drops, like some pickables found in dungeons, the random drops will be disabled for player-built instances of the piece. World-generated instances are unaffected and will picking them will drop the random drops as normal.

### Mineable Pieces
Any piece that you can hit with a pickaxe and destroy parts of is a mineable piece (for anyone who has gone through the game code this is prefabs with a MineRock5 or MineRock component).

#### Resource Costs
All mineable pieces have the cost for building them adjusted so that building them always require resources equal to or greater than the average resources dropped when the mineable piece is completely mined.

#### Resource Drops
Deconstructing mineable pieces effectively "mines" the entire piece and per vanilla behavior the dropped resources are slightly randomized (as if you had mined it). When deconstructing mineable pieces the resources required to build it are returned after subtracting the average resources dropped by fully mining the piece.

**Example:** If you built a rock that on average drops 41 stone, it would cost 41 stone to build. If you configured that rock to cost 56 stone, built it, and deconstructed it then it would drop 15 stone plus whatever is randomly dropped due to mining the entire piece which will on average result in dropping 56 stone, but could be slightly more or less. If you configured the rock to cost 41 stone and 2 iron, then it would always drop 2 iron when removed and whatever is dropped due to mining the entire piece.

## ItemStand Pieces
Any piece that you can attach an item to has an ItemStand component and has a unique behavior when deconstructed.

#### ItemStand Drops
When you deconstruct a piece that has an ItemStand component it will always drop the attached item, even if you could not normally remove it.

## Known Issue/Feature
MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs is able to detect prefabs added by other mods. It is possible to enable and configure those prefabs much like the Vanilla prefabs added by MVBP. In some cases, prefabs from other mods can cause issues, though it is uncommon. As a general rule, I will not patch prefabs from other mods as I do not have access to the assets from other mods. Please still let me know if a prefab from another mod causes issues so I can prevent MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs from enabling it though. Additionally, if the other mod author is willing to collaborate regarding the issue I am open to that.

## Known Issues
**Placement Glitch**: There is one pickable that falls through the terrain when placed, making it appear to not have been placed. After a short period of time it will be pushed to the surface and appear so give it a moment.

**Impossible Recipes**: Forcing pickable pieces to always require resources equal to or greater than what they drop when picked means that if a pickable is unattainable in the Vanilla game, then the recipe for it can never be unlocked. I am currently considering how I want to address this and whether this should be considered a bug or not as it is a consequence of the intended behavior to prevent infinite resource exploits. It is still possible to unlock these recipes via console commands or using other mods like [ExpandWorld](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Expand_World_Data/) or [Immersively Obtainable Blue Mushrooms](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Immersively_Obtainable_Blue_Mushrooms/) to populate those pickables in the world.

## Planned Improvements
- Find a way to make placing and removing liquids work.
- Make a pull request to PlanBuild that fixes the partial incompatibility.
- Learn how localization works and add localization options to the mod.

## Potential Improvements
- Add an **Unsafe** patch option that changes the inventory size of containers made of end-game materials.
- Add a Customization patch that improves the new ship added by this mod.


## Compatibility
These are non-exhaustive lists.

### Incompatible Mods
**PotteryBarn (by ComfyMods)** Currently both mods apply a transpiler patch to `Player.SetUpPlacementGhost()` and using MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs while PotteryBarn is installed will cause MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs to fail to load correctly. I am looking into a possible fix for this but it is not high priory as I think it is unlikely someone would use both mods at the same time given their functions directly overlap (I could be wrong though).

### Compatible Mods
All of my mods are fully compatible with eachother.

**PlantEverything (by Advize)**: These two mods are fully compatible. If PlantEverything is installed then MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs will not touch any of the prefabs that PlantEverything adds to the cultivator so all of the plants added by PlantEverything will function as normal. I also highly recommend using PlantEverything as it is targeted at providing a balanced and configurable experience for enabling more plant pieces and compliments MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs.

**Gizmo (by ComfyMods)**: Fully compatible and highly recommended if you like building.

**WackysDatabase (by Wackymole)**: These two mods are fully compatible. You can use WackyDB to alter pieces added by this mod. Depending on what you alter the dynamic configuration changes of this mod may override the change changes made by WackyDB when the mod updates in response to the config changes. To resolve this you can A.) avoid changing the config for this mod while in-game, B.) log out and rejoin to allow WackyDB to reapply it's changes, C.) use the wackydb_reload console command to reapply changes without exiting the game (probably the easiest and best option).

**PlanBuild (by MathiasDecrock)** The two mods are fully compatible as of PlanBuild v0.15.0.

**InfinityHammer, InfinityTools, ExpandWorldData, & ExpandWorldPrefabs (by Jere)** All of these mods are fully compatible with MoreVanillaBuildPrefabs and are often used together by world builders.

If you would like to provide suggestions, make feature requests, or reports bugs and compatibility issues you can either open an issue on the Github repository or tag me (@searica) with a message on my discord [Searica's Mods](https://discord.gg/sFmGTBYN6n).

Over time I will keep patching more prefabs and improving this mod's features but you'd really like a specific prefab to work better then let me know via one of the methods above. I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will always respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.
